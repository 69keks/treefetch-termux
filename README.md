# DISCLAIMER: ALL CREDITS TO @angelofallars on github for the program. I just edited it a little so it more or less works on termux.
* To-Do: Fix get_uptime function to work with `date` command just like neofetch as `/proc/uptime` is denied from being accessed on android.

# ðŸŒ³ `treefetch`

A lightning-fast minimalist system fetch tool made in Rust. Even faster than neofetch and pfetch. Made to practice my(angelofallars') new Rust skills ðŸ¦€.

A great pair for [cbonsai](https://gitlab.com/jallbrit/cbonsai), to help you get upvotes on your Linux rice.

More trees with `treefetch --bonsai` and `treefetch --xmas`!

# Setting up environment for treefetch to run
## Adding required files and env variables for the program to find and use
- create a file called `hostname` in `${PREFIX/etc/` and add your personal choice for hostname.
- create a file called `version` under `${PREFIX}/etc/` and add the output of `uname -r` as `Linux version <uname -r output>`
- create a file called lsb-release in `${PREFIX}/etc/` and add the following field and fill it accordingly.
`DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=''`
(This is because termux is not FHS compliant.) Only DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION is required out of the standard fields.
- add `export USER='<your personal choice>'` to `.bashrc` or `.profile` or `.bash_profile`.

## Compiling Manually is the only way to use this currently.

To compile and install treefetch manually, you first need to install the Rust
compiler `pkg install rust`.

- `git clone https://github.com/angelofallars/treefetch`
- `cd treefetch`
- `cargo install --path .`
- Add `export PATH="/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.cargo/bin:$PATH"` to `.bashrc` and run `. ~/.bashrc` in-case the dir is not in your termux's `$PATH`
